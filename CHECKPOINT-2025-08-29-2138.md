# Checkpoint — 2025-08-29 21:38 (local)

Summary:

- All core functionality is working locally in this workspace at this point.
- Server endpoint `/api/playwright/open-youtube` triggers Playwright and creates a screenshot.
- `playwright/openYoutube.ts` launches Chromium in headed mode when called with `show: true` and supports `--show` and `--wait-for-enter` CLI flags.
- Frontend `PlaywrightButton` calls `/api/playwright/open-youtube` and receives `{ ok: true, screenshotPath }`.

Key files changed/verified:

- `playwright/openYoutube.ts` — diagnostics, options `show` and `waitForEnter`, CLI runner.
- `server.ts` — `/api/playwright/open-youtube` now calls `openYouTube({ show: true })` and logs caller IP.
- `src/frontend/components/PlaywrightButton.tsx` — UI button that POSTs to the endpoint and displays the returned screenshot.

How to reproduce this checkpoint locally:

1. Install Playwright browsers (if not already):

   ```powershell
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. Start the dev server from repo root (PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the web UI at http://localhost:3000 and click "Open YouTube (Playwright)" or simulate the button with PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/playwright/open-youtube -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
   ```

4. If running locally, server console and `openYouTube` diagnostics will indicate headed mode and should leave a visible browser window (or wait for Enter if `waitForEnter` is used).

Notes and diagnostics to check if something stops working:

- Check server console for the diagnostics block printed by `openYouTube` (platform, detectedWSL, env.DISPLAY, decided show).
- Confirm the Node process is running in the same desktop session (not WSL/remote VM/container) if the browser is not visible.
- Screenshot files are saved under `public/` with names like `playwright-youtube-<timestamp>.png`.

If you want this checkpoint recorded as a git tag instead, tell me and I will create a lightweight `git` tag for the current HEAD.
